how large should the front and back of the flashcards be limited to in # of chars?
  - max length of tag? front limited to 200. back textarea

spaced repetition algorithm? supermemo2 - modified by priority & by content
limit number of test items

tags by space, tags by comma? how is it delimited? comma

when you search, how should user be notified that a tag doesnt exist in the system?
Currently, these tags do not filter the search (intentionally) -  but doesnt user want
to know that a specific tag isnt affecting the search?

duplicate cards of the same person?

only AJAX compatible? what about the js blocked users? UI - build the best, and make it backwards compatible.
or build the worst and make it forwards fancy? basic first.

recaptcha for newusers? someone said they didnt like them
captcha alternative - use blank input field, if it fills up then its a bot

incoming mail address. something@thoughtsaver.com - outgoing mail address test@thoughtsaver.com?


__________my own notes - they wont make sense to anyone else_______________________
user --> card
duplicate cards? right?

search within own:
same as b4 w/ user in query

-->
DB - better to have user on card if its duplicate

stu - refs to owner. sounds good!
